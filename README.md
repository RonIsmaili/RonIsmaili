## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ thanks for coming by!

I am Ron Ismaili, a second year computer science student at the South East European University (SEEU) in Tetovo, North Macedonia.

The following are some of the projects I have worked on:

# **Python:**
During my semester in Spain, at Universidad Loyola, I took the course **Data And Image Analytics** where we worked with data. This was the first time I had ever worked with data and I have learned a lot from this course. <br>
The main libraries which we used were: Pandas, Scikit-learn, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

In this course I have tried to determine the gender of an individual when their full name is given, determine if an individual would survive the tragedy of the Titanic and much more. If you are interested, please take a better look at my projects by *[clicking me](https://github.com/RonIsmaili/Data-And-Image-Analytics)*.

# **C++:**
During my 2nd semester at SEEU I had the course Object Oriented Programming (in C++) where I decided to create a text-based video game as a project, using all of the concepts we covered during our classes.

The main purpose of this project is to demonstrate my strong fundamentals in the C++ programming language as well as my knowledge of OOP concepts (such as inheritance and polymorphism).

The theme of this video game is guessing which company will generate the greatest profit, **Guess Da Profit (GDP)**, where every round has new companies to choose from. If you want to play it for yourself, or take a look at my work, please check it out by *[clicking me](https://github.com/RonIsmaili/Guess-Da-Profit)*.
