## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ thanks for coming by!

I am Ron Ismaili, a second year computer science student at the South East European University in Tetovo, North Macedonia.

The following are some of the projects I have worked on:

# **Python:**
During my semester in Spain, at Universidad Loyola, I took the course **Data And Image Analytics** where we worked with data. This was the first time I had ever worked with data and I have learned a lot from this course. <br>
The main libraries which we used were: Pandas, Scikit-learn, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

In this course I have tried to determine the gender of an individual when their full name is given, determine if an individual would survive the tragedy of the Titanic and much more. If you are interested, please take a better look at my projects by *[clicking me](https://github.com/RonIsmaili/Data-And-Image-Analytics)*.
