## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ thanks for coming by!

I am Ron Ismaili, a second year computer science student at the South East European University (SEEU) in Tetovo, North Macedonia.

The following are some of the projects I have worked on:

# **Python:**
During my third semester, at Universidad Loyola, I took the course **Data And Image Analytics** where we worked with data. This was the first time I had ever worked with data and I have learned a lot from this course. The main libraries which we used were: Pandas, Scikit-learn, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

In this course I have tried to determine the gender of an individual when their full name is given, determine if an individual would survive the tragedy of the Titanic and much more. If you are interested, please take a better look at my projects by *[clicking me](https://github.com/RonIsmaili/Data-And-Image-Analytics)*.

# **C++:**
During my second semester, at the South East European University, I took the course **Object Oriented Programming** (in C++) where I decided to create a text-based video game as a project, using all of the concepts we covered during our classes.

The theme of this video game is guessing which company will generate the greatest profit, **Guess Da Profit (GDP)**, where every round has new companies to choose from. If you want to play it for yourself, or take a look at my work, please check it out by *[clicking me](https://github.com/RonIsmaili/Guess-Da-Profit)*.

# **VHDL:**
During my third semester, at Universidad Loyola, I took the course **Computer Architecture** where we attempted to implement a single cycle ARM CPU on a MiniZed FPGA using VHDL. This was one of the most involved projects I have ever worked on. 

I created a simple yet fully functioning single cycle ARM CPU which recognizes 12 different instructions (memory and data-processing instructions) and wrote a detailed documentation about my project. If you are interested at taking a look at my CPU or the documentation, please check it out by *[clicking me](https://github.com/RonIsmaili/mini-ARM-CPU)*. 

# **C#:**
During my third semester, at Universidad Loyola, I took the course **Motion Capture And 3D Animation** where we worked with 3D models. As a final project, all students of the group needed to work together to create a video game.

My contribution to this video game was writing the code for a mini game called Human Calculator. If you are interested at trying out my mini game or simply taking a look at the scripts I wrote, please check it out by *[clicking me](https://github.com/RonIsmaili/Human-Calculator)*.

# **SQL:**
During my current fourth semester, at the South East European University, I am taking the course **Databases** where we are working on creating our own database. 

If you are interested at looking what me and my group have created for our fictional computer company, OneZero, please check it out by *[clicking me](https://github.com/RonIsmaili/OneZero)*.

# **HTML, CSS & Javascript:**
During my second semester, at the South East European University, I took the course **Internet Technologies** where we had to work with HTML, CSS & Javascript to create a website for our final project.

I created a fully responsive and modern looking website using the above mentioned technologies. The theme of the website was around nature and hiking and that is why I called this project Nature And Hiking, if you are interested at taking a look, please check it out by *[clicking me](https://github.com/RonIsmaili/Nature-And-Hiking)*.
